# Pong--Clone

I started making the games in the CS50: Introduction to Game Development course on Harvard University's edx platform. This is Pong, the game of the first week of the course.

There are two options in the game. These are one player and two player. If we choose the one player option, we are playing against the computer. If we choose the Two player option, we play the game with two people. Controls are s and x keys for player 1, up and down arrow keys for player 2.
